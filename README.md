# LogicGateSim
A logic gate simulator.
Create a series of basic logic gates and have them compute a binary program.
At the moment it only supports creating gates within the Main.cpp itself
but it is to be expanded to load logic gate setups from custom hardware description
language files.

## Compiling
On linux, you create a "build" directory and do the commands;

cmake ..

cmake --build ..
